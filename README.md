# AI-Research-Project

Abstract:
This Project was about creating a classification model that can be used on a dataset of white wine samples. Pycaret was used for creating and running the models and pandas to read the dataset. Pycaret is a widely used tool for generating models and working with them and has a very well documented website if help is required which makes working with it very convenient. The aim for this model was to find the quality of wine for a given dataset. First a model was trained and stored being trained on given data. That model can then be used to decide the quality of a sample of wine just by getting the other variables. After creating a model, we than removed the quality column from the same data set and ran it through the model to generate the quality metric for each row item. The initial values for quality ranged from 0-10 which we in turn changed to just three classifications being poor, average and good. So, a wine with a quality 4 and below is “poor”, 5-7 is “average” and 8 and above is “good”.
